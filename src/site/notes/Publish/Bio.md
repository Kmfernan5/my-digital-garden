Bio

Dr. Turner-Lloveras is an internist and Executive Director of The Latino Health Innovation Alliance (LHIA), where he spearheads transformative health innovation projects to reduce disparities in healthcare and promote health equity.

Dr. Turner-Lloveras earned his medical degree at The Pritzker School of Medicine and completed residency training in Internal Medicine at Columbia University Medical Center. He served as a primary care provider at two FQHCs in South Central Los Angeles and Skid Row as a National Health Service Corps Scholar. He was also a founding faculty member of the Department of Medicine's Diversity & Inclusion Committee at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where he advocated for diversity in medicine.

Dr. Turner-Lloveras is a skilled coalition builder and is deeply connected in the digital health  ecosystem. He has successfully piloted campaigns to improve telehealth and internet access, build digital literacy, implement EHRs, and develop inclusive culturally aligned patient-facing consumer health applications. Under his leadership, he launched LHIA to catalyze the integration of social determinants of health and community collaboration to disrupt the culture around our traditionally siloed social health care systems.

Throughout his career, Dr. Turner-Lloveras has spearheaded a variety of transformative care delivery projects harnessing health information technology to reduce disparities in Black and Latino/communities. He has designed and evaluated interventions that address digital health inequities and overcome barriers to virtual health care adoption. In response to the pandemic, he developed remote teaching round protocols for medical students and residents, as well as cross-border virtual family visits to alleviate the psychological impact of family separation caused by hospital visitation restrictions.

In addition to his clinical and educational roles, Dr. Turner-Lloveras is the co-founder of SaludConTech, an inclusive, ecosystem-building community that offers entrepreneurial support to Latino/a/x/e founders and other underestimated innovators of color. By fostering an environment that encourages collaboration, mentorship, and resource sharing, SaludConTech empowers these diverse entrepreneurs to create groundbreaking solutions that address the unique health care needs of their communities.
